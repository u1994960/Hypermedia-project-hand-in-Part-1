        <h3>Uber simulator</h3>
        <p>This project simulates how a fleet of autonomous vehicles responds to client requests in a city environment. 
    Each car receives pickup requests, calculates the optimal route, and manages availability based on distance and time. 
    The simulation focuses on route optimization, request handling, and decision-making algorithms to improve efficiency and reduce waiting times. 
    It was developed as a university project combining programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving skills.</p>
