Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.
The site presents my professional profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a cleanlayout.
It was coded using HTML and CSS.


User Persona:

Persona: María, 30 years old, Product Manager at a tech company.

María regularly reviews candidates’ online portfolios when hiring new team members. She values practical, real-world experience in web development, clear project documentation, and well-structured layouts.
To meet her expectations, this website highlights my most relevant projects, lists the programing lenguages I use, and presents each experience in a concise, easy-to-read format. The contact section includes direct links to my Github profile and email address so that potential employers like María can reach out easily.


Information architecture:

The website is structured as a single-page application divided into clear sections to facilitate scanning and accessibility.
At the top, a fixed navigation bar allows users to jump directly to each section: About, Skills, Experience, Portfolio, and Contact.

The landing section provides a brief personal introduction and professional tagline. The Skills section follows where the coding lenguages I can use are listed. Next comes Experience, presented as cards with company name, role, dates, and key achievements. The Portfolio section showcases the bigest projects I've done with short descriptions and links to source code to show what I am capable of.

Finally, the Contact section includes direct communication options such as email while the footer provides credits and a link to my personal GitHub.
The structure follows a top-down hierarchy—from general overview to detailed evidence of skills—allowing both quick scanning and deeper exploration. Accessibility was considered through adequate color contrast.

Additionally, the website maintains consistent spacing and visual rhythm between sections to ensure a smooth reading flow. The sticky navigation bar keeps orientation clear, and headings follow a logical order to support screen readers. These structural choices create an intuitive browsing experience that emphasizes clarity, ease of navigation, and professional presentation to the employer.

Visual design:

The visual design follows a minimal yet colorful style to achieve both professionalism and personality. The main color palette is deep blue (#0077ff), orange (#ff6f61), and  green (#00c9a7) on a white background.The green accent is used sparingly to provide balance. These colors create a harmonious and energetic look that keeps the interface engaging without overwhelming the user.

Typography uses Poppins for modern readability, with varying weights to create visual hierarchy between titles and body text. White areas ensure clarity and focus. Interactive elements include hover effects and smooth transitions to add subtle movement without distracting from the main content. Buttons and project cards respond with color changes and shadows to provide visual feedback, improving usability and perceived quality.

Each section uses consistent grid alignment and rounded containers to maintain a friendly, cohesive look. The layout is fully responsive, adapting from multi-column desktop views to stacked single-column layouts on mobile screens. The header features a gradient background that reinforces brand identity, while the footer uses a solid tone to create a visual anchor at the bottom of the page.

The chosen design aims to communicate creativity and attention to detail while keeping functionality and readability as priorities. These visual decisions ensure that visitors, recruiters, and collaborators can easily navigate, enjoy the aesthetics, and focus on the content that represents my professional profile.
